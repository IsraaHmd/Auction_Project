1)Concerning checking if the user is logged in:
In Django, you can check if a user is authenticated (logged in) using the is_authenticated attribute of the user object.
In your view function, you can use request.user.is_authenticated.
This will return True if the user is logged in and False otherwise. Here's an example:

def some_view(request):
    if request.user.is_authenticated:
        # User is logged in, do something
    else:
        # User is not logged in, do something else
Remember, request.user will always be available in your views, even if the user is not logged in. In that case, request.user is an instance of AnonymousUser.
but in models i have class User(AbstractUser):
pass

ddb
The User model you have defined is inheriting from Django's built-in AbstractUser model. This means your User model will have all the fields and methods of the AbstractUser model, including the is_authenticated attribute.
So, you can still use request.user.is_authenticated in your views to check if a user is logged in, even with your custom User model.
2) to use form.isvalid() ==>in Django, when you say form = bid(request.POST), you're trying to instantiate a form class named bid with the POST data. However, in your HTML form, you're not using Django's form handling but rather a simple HTML form.If you want to use Django's form validation, you should create a Django form class
3) one to many relationship:
In Django, you can represent this relationship using the ForeignKey field. For example, in your Bid model, you might have something like this:

listing = models.ForeignKey(Listing, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
This creates a one-to-many relationship from Listing to Bid: each Listing can have multiple Bids, but each Bid is associated with exactly one Listing
Detailed explanation: A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table, that is used to link to a field (usually the primary key) in another table. The table containing the foreign key is called the child table, and the table containing the candidate key is called the referenced or parent table.

In the context of Django and your Bid model, the listing field is a foreign key. It points to an instance of the Listing model. When you create a Bid object, you can associate it with a Listing object. Behind the scenes, Django stores the primary key of the Listing object in the listing field of the Bid object. This is how the association between the two is made.

When you query a Bid object, you can access the associated Listing object directly through the listing field. Django will automatically fetch the Listing object that has the primary key stored in the Bid object's listing field.

The on_delete=models.CASCADE option means that if the associated Listing object is deleted, Django will also delete the Bid object. This is to maintain the integrity of the data: it prevents having Bid objects that point to non-existent Listing objects.

you
Do in need to define a pk in the Listing class

ddb
In Django, you don't need to explicitly define a primary key field in your model. If you don't specify it, Django will automatically create an id field in your model. This id field is an auto-incrementing integer that serves as the primary key for the model. So, for your Listing model, if you haven't defined a primary key, Django will automatically create one for you.


4) related name:
In Django, you can specify a related_name option in your ForeignKey field to set a custom name for the reverse relation from the Listing model back to the Bid model.

Here's how you can do it:

listing = models.ForeignKey(Listing, on_delete=models.CASCADE, related_name='bids')
Now, if you have a Listing object listing, you can get all associated Bid objects like this:

bids = listing.bids.all()
The related_name option is useful for creating more readable and intuitive code.

5)In Django, request.user is an instance of the User model representing the currently logged-in user. If the user is not logged in, request.user will be an instance of AnonymousUser.

You can use request.user in your views to access information about the current user. For example, request.user.username would give you the username of the currently logged-in user.

Remember, to use request.user, you need to have Django's authentication system properly set up, and the user needs to be logged in.

6)ManyToMany rlt datatype: In Django, the ManyToManyField creates a many-to-many relationship, which is essentially a set of objects. However, it's not a Python set or list. It's a Django QuerySet object, which is a collection of objects from your database.
It can be filtered, sliced, and generally passed around just like a Python list, but it also has extra methods and behaves differently in some cases.
7)In: <div>
    <img src="{{listing.image_url}}" alt="Listing Image" style="max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%;"> </div>
  max-width: 100%; max-height: 100%; are essential to always make sure that the image will take up to 100% of the width and height of its
immediate container, which is the <div> in this case. If the <div> doesn't have a specific size set, it will expand to fit the size of its contents.-->
8)In Django, a ForeignKey is a type of database field that is used to create a one-to-many relationship. In your case, each bid is related to one listing, and each listing can have many bids. When you set listings=L1, you're not adding to a list, but rather you're setting the listing that this particular bid is associated with. If you want to see all bids associated with a listing, you can use the related name 'bids' that you've set up. For example, L1.bids.all() would give you all bids associated with the listing 'L1'.
9)    #Actually, in your bid model, you would want to use a ForeignKey field for the user attribute.
    #This is because each bid is associated with one user, but one user can have many bids.
10)simply i have user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True) and here we said null = true because django is forcing me to put a
default but it is not logical to have a bid with null user so always ensure that there is a user in views
11) get_or_create:
"When a new listing is created, you can check if the category already exists" give me a hint how

ddb
You can use Django's get_or_create method, which tries to get an object with the given parameters. If it doesn't exist, it creates one. Here's a small hint:

category, created = Category.objects.get_or_create(name=form.cleaned_data['category'])
In this line, get_or_create returns a tuple. The first element is the object you're looking for, and the second is a boolean that is True if the object was created and False if it already existed. You can then assign this category to your new listing.

you
why you said category, created

ddb
The get_or_create method in Django returns a tuple containing two elements. The first element is the object that was either fetched or created. The second element is a boolean value that is True if a new object was created and False if the object already existed.

So when we say category, created = Category.objects.get_or_create(...), we're using Python's tuple unpacking feature to assign the returned object to category and the boolean value to created. This way, we can easily check if a new category was created or if an existing one was used.
